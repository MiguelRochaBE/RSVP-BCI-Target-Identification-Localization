In order to use the oculus rift in conjunction with PychoPy, the package offers full support to render VR scenes with steroscopic view of stimuli by installing the subpackage psychxr in the conda environment. However, this subpackage has code wirtten in C++ to provide a more efficient setup of VR presented stimuli with python. Because of this, functionalities within visual studio had to be setup to compile the code in C++ (build tools for visual studio 2022) and consequently, install the package properly within the python environment. This required a lot of troubleshooting as the python environment was not able to find the right versions of the executables within windows to properly compile the package. This required some variables including paths and oculus rift SDK properties to be configured and set in the python environment according to the documentation of psychxr. Unfortunately, even after all C++ compiling issues were resolved, more erros occured during instalation related to additional variables that were needed to be initialized in the SDK and for some reason were not during the various processes of instalation. These were required to properly retrieve SDK services to install the psychxr package. There was no sign of these variables in both the SDK and psychxr documentation. Because this is also a very niche use in psychopy, no information could be found online to resolve this low level issue within the Oculus VR SDK and therefore, this approach was abandoned and a decision to use a normal PC screen was taken.

We also tried to use the oculus as a simple second screen in psychopy. However, the stimuli were clearly not setup correclty and the use a supported package that handles the right setup and configuration to display images correctly within the rift were required.
